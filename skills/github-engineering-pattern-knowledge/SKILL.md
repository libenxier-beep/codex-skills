# GitHub Engineering Pattern Knowledge

Use this skill to operate the `github-pattern-knowledge` tool and keep its outputs suitable for agent reuse. The durable artifact is the Work Contexts knowledge base, not the dashboard.

## Use When

- A user wants to learn from GitHub repositories into a local engineering-pattern knowledge base.
- A seed list, daily extraction run, archive/skip registry, or dashboard needs to be created or maintained.
- Pattern notes need retrieval tags, progressive disclosure, source evidence, indexes, or harness validation.
- A GitHub token, rate-limit behavior, or already-learned repository archive affects ingestion.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is ordinary GitHub repository triage, PR review, or CI debugging.
- The user only wants a one-off summary of a single repository with no durable knowledge write.
- The target is long-term personal memory rather than a Work Contexts engineering knowledge base.

## Project Contract

- Tool repo: `github-pattern-knowledge`.
- Default knowledge root: `$CODEX_HOME/memories/work_contexts/github_engineering_patterns`.
- Generated knowledge directories: `patterns/`, `indexes/`, `cards/`, `registry/`, `sources/`, `runs/`, `rejected/`, and `schemas/`.
- Learned archive: `registry/learned_repos.json`.
- Seed archive: `registry/seed_repos.json`.
- Public tool repository: `https://github.com/libenxier-beep/github-pattern-knowledge`.

Keep secrets in `.env.local` or the shell environment. Never commit `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `.env`, `.env.local`, `node_modules`, `dist`, or generated private knowledge data unless the user explicitly asks for a public export.

## Operating Flow

1. Inspect the current repo and knowledge root before changing anything.
2. Load `.env.local` or require `GITHUB_TOKEN` only when GitHub rate limits block ingestion.
3. For seed work, update or read `registry/seed_repos.json`, then run `npm run seed -- --limit N` or `npm run seed -- --repos owner/name`.
4. For daily work, run `npm run daily`; it should prefer pending seed repos unless `--skip-seeds` is used.
5. Before selecting a repo, check `registry/learned_repos.json`; learned repos must be skipped.
6. After accepted writes, regenerate indexes and cards, then run the harness.
7. For dashboard changes, verify both API output and the UI.

## Pattern Note Standard

Accepted pattern notes must be Markdown with YAML frontmatter and must include source traceability:

- `source_repos[].repo`, `source_repos[].url`, and concrete `reference_files`
- retrieval fields such as engineering problem, project type, pattern type, transfer targets, complexity, and quality score
- body sections for engineering problem, core judgment, use/avoid conditions, design forces, boundary decisions, failure modes, alternatives, transfer guidance, implementation hint, and source evidence

Each note should support progressive disclosure:

- frontmatter and retrieval tags for fast filtering
- a short summary and core judgment for first read
- boundary decisions and failure modes for implementation judgment
- source evidence for audit

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run seed -- --list
npm run seed -- --limit 3
npm run daily
npm run index
npm run harness
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## Validation Gate

Before claiming the knowledge base or website is ready, run the relevant checks:

- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run harness`
- API check for `/api/knowledge/summary` or `/api/knowledge/archive` when archive/dashboard behavior changed

Report exact counts for learned repos, pending repos, checked files, and failures.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating human-facing cards as the agent-readable source of truth.
- Re-learning repos already recorded in `learned_repos.json`.
- Adding tags without regenerating indexes.
- Publishing local secrets or generated private Work Contexts data.
- Claiming completion without harness and dashboard/API verification.
